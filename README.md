# recipe_recommender
This is a recipe recommendation model that suggests similar recipes based on nutritional value, ingredient characteristics, recipe type, and dietary constraints like gluten or lactose intolerance.

1. Overview:
The model is a content-based recommender system that analyzes the features of a recipe and suggests others with similar attributes. It leverages a feature-rich representation of recipes and filters based on user constraints.

2. Core Components:
üîç Input Data Representation:
Each recipe is represented as a feature vector composed of:

Nutritional Values: (normalized per 100g or per serving)

Calories, Protein, Carbohydrates, Fat, Fiber, Sugar, etc.

Ingredient Features:

Ingredient Name: Represented via one-hot encoding or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).

Ingredient Amount: Scaled quantities (e.g., 2 cups, 200g, 1 tsp).

Ingredient Volume/Weight: Converted to a common unit for consistency.

Ingredient Types: (e.g., dairy, meat, grain, vegetable) using an ontology.

Recipe Type:

Categories like "dessert", "main course", "vegan", "keto", etc.

Constraints:

Binary flags for dietary restrictions (e.g., gluten-free = 1, contains gluten = 0).

3. Model Architecture:
üîß Feature Encoding:
Use a combination of:

TF-IDF / Bag-of-Words: for ingredient names.

Numerical scaling/standardization: for nutrition and quantity values.

Embeddings or categorical encoding: for recipe type and dietary flags.

üß† Similarity Engine:
Cosine Similarity or Euclidean Distance on the recipe vectors.

Optional dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA or autoencoders) for performance and interpretability.

üßº Filtering Layer (Constraints Engine):
Applies hard filters based on user preferences:

Exclude recipes containing gluten/lactose (matches against a labeled ingredient DB).

Include only recipes matching user‚Äôs preferred types or nutritional targets (e.g., low-carb).

4. Recommendation Workflow:
User inputs or selects a recipe.

System converts that recipe to its feature vector.

Computes similarity between the selected recipe and all others in the database.

Applies dietary constraint filters.

Returns top-N similar recipes.

5. Enhancements:
User profiling: Learn from user interactions (ratings, saves, skips).

Multi-modal embeddings: Incorporate image features or cooking instructions.

Explainability module: Explain why a recipe was recommended (e.g., ‚Äúsimilar protein content and uses rice instead of pasta‚Äù).

6. Example Use Case:
User selects a "chicken stir fry" recipe, and specifies:

Gluten intolerance

Prefers low-carb options

System returns:

A "gluten-free chicken lettuce wrap" with similar protein/fat levels.

A "low-carb turkey skillet" using similar seasonings but different protein source.
